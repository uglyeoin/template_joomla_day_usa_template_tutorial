# Joomla Day USA Template tutorial

## Step 1
1. Add the required files.  
2. Now Zip it up and install it.  Don't move on until it installs.
3. Now that you have done that, you can rename all the author elements in templateDetails.xml
4. Change the template_preview.png and template_thumnail.png files
5. Ok now you're ready for Step 2

##Step 2
1. Add the component.

In Joomla! the component displays a component which is decided by the menu item.  You may commonly use things like com_content to show article blogs.  Or perhaps a single article.  Or perhaps you have a forms extension.  Or a shop.  Whatever it is, if we don't load the component it won't be able to load.

However, in some cases, you really don't want a component.  Say for example a page where you wanted only modules.  In those cases, simply omit the component.
